# Interpress Conformance Suite 6.0

## Origin

- ICS 6.0
- Cat. No XSI-101001
- November 21, 1988
- 24 diskettes in MSDOS 2.x backup format


## Process

This is recovered software from a set of Xerox 5 1/4" floppies from 1988.
It is a set of files that your Interpress printer should be able to handle.

- I imaged them with a Kryoflux to get MSDOS 2.2 disk images
- pulled the files of those, they were in MSDOS 2.x backup format
- wrote a tool to convert backup sets to files

Most of this is fine. A few disks gave different images on each pass.
This usually impacted just a few files. 

What I am missing is the guide that goes along with them, to show you what
the images should look like.
